# Flash-Card-Program
I am currently studying Japanese, and I have created a flashcard app to assist me in learning and memorizing Japanese vocabulary in Kanji, their readings in Hiragana, and their meanings in English.


- *I created the graphical interface using the Tkinter library.
- *The application displays flashcards with Japanese words on one side and their English meaning on the other side.
- *Add New Words: The application provides a function for users to add new Japanese words, along with their hiragana writing and English meaning.
- *PIL (Python Imaging Library): Used to resize and manipulate images in the user interface.
- *Pandas: Used to handle data in the form of DataFrames (to load, manipulate, and save data in CSV files).
- *Random: Used for the random selection of words from the vocabulary list.
